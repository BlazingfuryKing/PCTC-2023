Not content with paying caf√© prices, Eric has instead bought himself a second-hand milkshake machine. 

Unfortunately, it isn't fully working and instead issues a random number of units of milkshake between 1 and 5 inclusive each time he presses the button.

Eric's glass holds 12 units altogether. He likes his glass to be full, so he keeps pressing the button until it is.

This often results in some overspill into the drip tray.

Jeremy has a deal with Eric that he can always have any milkshake that spills into the drip tray.

Repeatedly input the number of units of milkshake dispensed until Eric's cup is full.

Output the number of overflowed units of milkshake that Jeremy gets to drink from the drip tray.

Input Format
A sequence of positive whole numbers 1 to 5, each on a separate line
