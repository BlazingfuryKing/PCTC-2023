'''
When signing up to a new service, users are often asked to type a new password choice in again to verify that it matches the first one.

In Joe's website, he wants to be super sure that the user has not made a mistake so he asks for the password three times.

Input the password three times and output:

OK if all three passwords are the same
BOTH MISMATCH if both the second and third passwords are different to the first
ENTRY 2 MISMATCH if only the second password is different to the first
ENTRY 3 MISMATCH if only the third password is different to the first
'''

word1 = str(input())
word2 = str(input())
word3 = str(input())

if word1 == word2 and word1 == word3:
  print("OK")
elif word1 != word2 and word1 != word3:
  print("BOTH MISMATCH")
elif word1 != word2:
  print("ENTRY 2 MISMATCH")
else:
  print("ENTRY 3 MISMATCH")
