Jackie runs a charitable coding club in her village for young people.

The laptops that she uses have been donated by a local company but she does have some costs which she needs to fund-raise for:

an annual fee of £x for the hall that she uses
£y per student per month for subscriptions to the online learning platform that she uses
Input x (the annual hall fee), y (the monthly subscription fee) and z (the number of children in the club) and output the total cost of running the club for the year.

x = int(input())
y = int(input())
z = int(input())
print(x+y*z*12)
